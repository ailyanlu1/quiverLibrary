The number of different $k$-element subsets (when each element can be chosen only once) of $n$-element set is:\n\n$$ ^n C_k = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} $$\n\nCombination with repetition\n\nLet’s say we choose $k$ elements from an $n$-element set, the order doesn’t matter and each element can be chosen more than once. In that case, the number of different combinations is:\n\n$$ ^{n + k - 1} C_k $$\n\nThis is also the number of solutions for the following integer equation:\n\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = k , (x_i >= 0 i \\in [1,n] $$\n\nThe number of such solutions are calculated by finding the power of $x_k$ in the polynomial expansion of the LHS. Which is the product of sum of raising the power of each $x$ to its each possible value for every $x_i$."

For example, “XXYY” and “XYXY” are Dyck words, but “XYYX” and “YYXX” are not.\n* **Diagonal avoiding paths:** Counting number of staircase (only move right or up) paths from (0,0) to (n,n) in a square grid that don't cross the diagonal line from (0,0) to (n,n).\n* Counting the number of *\"mountain ranges\"* that can be constructed using n upstrokes and n downstrokes such that the *\"mountain range\"* always stays above the original line.\n* **Polygon Triangulation:** Counting the number of ways in which a regular polygon of n + 2 sides can be triangulated.\n* **Non-Crossing Handshakes:** If 2n people are seated around a circular table, in how many ways can all of them be simultaneously shaking hands with another person at the table in such a way that none of the arms cross each other."
